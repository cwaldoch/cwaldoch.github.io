# Groundsource Heat Pumps are not Geothermal

I just wanted to clear up this misconception I hear quite a bit in the home energy and efficiency space when people are talking about ground source heat pumps (GSHPs). GSHPs rely on the temperature of the soil a few meters down. The temperature at that depth is roughly the average annual air temperature for the area in which the installation exists. This is also why the type of soil matters and why regionally GSHPs have different efficiencies. Soil conductivity even plays a part, and relatively recent glacial till (such as in the upper midwest) is going to perform very differently than the high desert of Utah. On the other hand, we have geothermal. It should be evident from considering the term geothermal briefly that it refers to something different. Specifically, the heat (thermal) of the earth (geo) itself. This can be close to the surface in rare instances (think hot springs or volcanoes), but is also a fact of life as you go deeper into the earth's crust. 

## A Look at Geothermal

[MIT and INL produced an excellent report on this resource](https://energy.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2006/11/MITEI-The-Future-of-Geothermal-Energy.pdf) over a decade ago (the real money maps start on page 62). In most cases, geothermal resources are looked at from a largescale engineering perspective, so that even when this resource is close enough to the surface to be efficient for home heating it tends to be a district or municipality-level resource. I mean, look at the costs associated with geothermal wells surveyed in the paper, they're well outside the range of an individual homeowner.

Finally, these maps of ground surface temperature and then the temperature at a depth of 3.5km are also useful for additional context. Additionally, the ground surface temperatures show why GSHPs are so efficient (and only fractionally as efficient during the winter) in their summertime cooling applications across the midwest and great plains.
