# Weekly Roundup
------

As part of establishing consistency, I'll be doing brief weekly roundups. Not touching on everything I read, did, or am thinking about, but just some highlights from the previous week. Categories might shift, so don't get too attached to anything. I'll also be writing most of these on my phone while commuting, so the editing might not be immediately perfect.
