### Weekly Roundup No. 6 March 8th, 2018


Heading into the strong crunch time of my year. Annual report season stretches from mid-January into May, escalating along the way. This time of March is when I look around and realize I'm about to submerge for good for a bit. All said, these sections might be shorter moving forward, although up to this point I've suprised myself with the amount of reading I've been able to cram in around the edges.It's easy enough for me to include links, always harder to write up any narrative.

## Thinkings About

* Why do movie+TV adds to streaming services seem cheaper than music (or books). Are the publishing industries weaker? Are the royalty streams less?
* I heard recent times described as a "protectionist moment", but both parties seem aginst tariffs, along with most people, and nearly all thinkers on the topic. Maybe the president is just bad at critical thinking and has surrounded himself with yes men and idiots. Doesnt seem like a particularly profound moment, but does feel like the product of a cable-tv-news-riddled septugenarian brain.
