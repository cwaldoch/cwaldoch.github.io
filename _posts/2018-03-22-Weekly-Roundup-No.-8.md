### Weekly Roundup No. 8 March, 22, 2018

I'm on a train to NYC for a bachelor party, I can't come up with any coherent narrative. There are many emails with links I've sent to myself, but I can't quite get everything in order, so this will have to suffice.


## Things
* Historic transit of the capital area ([Flickr](https://flic.kr/p/E424mM))
* Conspiracy lawyers supporting Trump ([WaPo](https://www.washingtonpost.com/amphtml/news/the-fix/wp/2018/03/19/trump-is-reportedly-hiring-a-conspiracy-theorist-for-his-legal-team-heres-what-joe-digenova-has-said/))
* How does AT&T deal not trip the HMT (hypothetical monopoly test), a small but measurable and enduring increase in costs is clearly a trigger for this type of enforcement. "Non-transitory" is the key language and it meets that.
* Congestion Pricing in NBER ([NBER](http://www.nber.org/papers/w24410?utm_campaign=ntw&utm_medium=email&utm_source=ntw))

## A timeline, beginning summer, 2016.
1. James Comey awkwardly and publicly "closes" the Hillary Clinton investigation while also admonishing her with weird non-legal language.
2. Election continues into the fall.
3. Concurrently, the Obama administration is wracked with indecision over what to do about the Russian meddling in the election that they now know to be occurring.
4. Reaching the conclusion that a bipartisan statement is required in order to not be accused of subverting the election, the administration reaches out to Republican congressional leaders.
5. Despite intelligence agency agreement on the topic, Mitch McConnell refuses to go public with any joint statement, killing the effort to let Americans know what was up.
6. Each time a potential Trump scandal shows up Wikileaks begins dumping new Clinton-connected emails.
7. A story breaks on the investigation into Russian activity, but is immediately swamped by the appearance of the Hollywood Access tape that same weekend.
8. Election enters final stages, Trump is within a polling error of Clinton.
9. FBI discovers possible source of new Clinton emails.
10. Due to the widely known preference of many FBI agents for Trump, Comey writes a letter to preempt what are considered to be inevitable anti-Clinton leaks of this information.
11. This letter dominates the news cycles leading into the election, and ultimately probably costs Hillary victory. This letter's impact is greatly heightened by Comey's original (and odd) public closure/admonishment of Hillary Clinton.
12. Simultaneously the New York Times ran a piece that Russia had been cleared of all potential wrongdoing related to the election. There has still been no explanation for this piece, but it seems to have clearly been a planted story or reporter overreach on thin sources.
13. Too late, the FBI confirms that nothing was found in these "new" emails.


## So, a few notes.
* Mitch McConnell basically spent 2016 kneecapping American democracy and institutions, from the Supreme Court to presidential elections, he did everything in his power to diminish their established norms.
* Comey probably cost Clinton the election, *and* it was predicated on the fact that the FBI was so anti-Clinton and pro-Trump (at least in the New York office) that he sent a letter about the new emails to avoid internal leaks. That reflects extremely poorly on the FBI's internal process and controls, particularly in opposition to:
* The Obama administration, which was struggling over what to say or do about the ongoing Russia investigation. Obama ultimately decided to have faith in American institutions and processes, which perversely helped lead to the norms-averse Trump administration whose values come directly from the twisted cable-news minds of Fox News commentators.
