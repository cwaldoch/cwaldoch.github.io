### Weekly Roundup No. 5 March 2nd, 2018

A lot going on this week in and around the White House. You might not have even heard that his pick to head Indian Health Services said he ran a hospital, but it turns out he was just a clerk who most dealt with things like patient registration. Still probably a better pick than the Ivy League adjacent frat boys populating slightly lower levels of political appointment, but horrible nonetheless. It reminds me of some political theorizing I heard around a year ago as the fight over Trump's cabinet was heating up. 

The gist of the argument is that while it might seem useful and good to the Trump team to fight hard for unqualified cronies to get those high-level appointments their lack of real qualifications (Carson), inability to even understand their purpose (Perry/DeVos), or fundamental disagreement with the mission (Pruitt) would ultimately cause far more political harm as they either departed, caused constant bad press for the administration, or inadvertently caused/exacerbated a crisis. 

We've seen this play out over and over throughout the administration's first year (although not as much at the cabinet level, yet), to the point where it seems like the preferable outcome would have been to put forward pure the ideologue, lose confirmation by a vote or two, and then easily pass a steady, but qualified and knowledge conservative. At least, that seems like a more reasonable strategy to me. Don't forget, [Trump's been pushing for his private pilot to lead the FAA](https://www.axios.com/exclusive-trump-privately-pushing-personal-pilot-to-run-faa-1519595187-5a735cc4-63e6-4348-b980-1aadf0b8e80d.html)!

## Trump's Corruption and General Incompetence

It's happening all around us, all of the time. This week there seemed to be quite a bit of it, so let's give it its own section!

* Let's start with this piece from Matt Yglesias on just the very thorough way that Trump has subverted and corrupted traditional norms and laws in order to profit. Dude has no empathy, desparately craves cash, is devoid of ethics, and happens to be President.

# Thinking about

* How much worse would Japan's suicide problem be in America?

* America's gun problem is so bad that basically anything makes it better 

* The political feedback loop for gun restriction will and should be strong, even just due to demographics. The NRA's tactics and it becoming piece of an individual minority group in the united states almost ensures things will change 

* Those with the least level of exposure to gun violence want guns the most and vice versa, more gun violence, less guns, suburbs have mass school shootings, urban areas with a low level, consistent violence, but these rural and exurban jerks think it's all fine and good, their sympathy does not extend to those who are actually exposed to gun violence, even though they have their own suicide problems. 

* This is the opposite of the gay marriage issue evolution. The more it's a cultural issue, the more they cede their quite spotty constitutional ground. 

* Freight train vs trucks vs commuter rail vs driving, emissions optimality

* Americans to-be initially rejected the city in founding and colonization only to create one of its purest forms and the urban juggernaut of at least the latter half of the 20th century. Or did they? Well, I guess the longstanding affection for yards, gated communities, and suburbs speaks to some inner desire to be of the landed. I want to say that goes all the way back to very early communities in New Jersey along with the various agrarian, technophobic religious sects that have occasionally taken root.
