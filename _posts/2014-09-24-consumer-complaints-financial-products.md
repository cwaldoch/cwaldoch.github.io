The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has been collecting consumer complaints for 3 years, and has apparently been collecting them into [one of the most usable government databases I've ever seen](https://data.consumerfinance.gov/dataset/Consumer-Complaints/x94z-ydhh?). This is particularly neat given the qualitative nature of many of these complaints. The CFPB was only [created in 2011 after the 2010 passage of the Doddâ€“Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_Financial_Protection_Bureau), which might explain why its website appears far more modern than most federal endeavors. The data has a lot of potential, but here are a few tidbits I grabbed right away.

First, I noticed that each complaint was entered with a zipcode, and I wondered which had seen the most complaints. Here's the top ten, along with their actual location (first town name result based on a quick google search).

Florida and California are both well-represented, although I was surprised to see a Michigan zip code take the top spot. Perhaps these are areas with high concentrations of retired individuals?

In a similar vein, here are the top ten "Issues" reported in the database.
