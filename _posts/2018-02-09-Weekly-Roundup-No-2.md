* Rosslyn metro station looks like nothing more than a giant mausoleum.

* There's something about millennials supposedly not having enough kids, but as a big generation they're probably not going to have as many kids, plus coming up during a recession, what's up with birth rates and recessions?

* [Yelp's Local Economic Outlook](https://www.yahoo.com/amphtml/finance/news/yelp-releases-local-economic-outlook-140000060.html#click=https://t.co/2DY6EKpBqa)
