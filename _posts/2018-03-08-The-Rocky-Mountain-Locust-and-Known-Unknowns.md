# The Rocky Mountain Locust and the Risks of Known (but forgotten) Unknowns

This week I happened across a mention of the Rocky Mountain Locust in a [New Yorker piece on the brown marmorated stinkbug](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/03/12/when-twenty-six-thousand-stinkbugs-invade-your-home) which piqued my interest. From its brief description it sounded like an important facet of American expansion west and perhaps a key element of the economic and agricultural history of the region in the latter half of the 19th century. The fact that I couldn't recall learning about a recurring plague than ended not even 150 years ago spoke to a few things. In specific terms, the focus the American education system places on the east coast institutions during this time frame, and, more broadly, the ability of nature to bring considerable havoc to bear, coupled with the capacity of humans to forget.

My interest somewhat aroused, I turned first to Wikipedia to find out more about this North American plague, and left the (short) article even more incensed. I gathered that the locust had indeed swarmed to a size exceeding California (~12 trillion insects), disappeared for good less than 30 years later, and left North America the only continent without an extant strain of locusts. It wasn't confirmed extinct for over 100 years after the last sighting, and the only useful remains we had were collected as rotting corpses out of newly exposed glacial faces. 

This information in hand, I resumed googling, and stumbled across a review of a book on the topic at [EconomicHistory.net](http://eh.net/book_reviews/locust-the-devastating-rise-and-mysterious-disappearance-of-the-insect-that-shaped-the-american-frontier/). The book,[Locust: The Devastating Rise and Mysterious Disappearance of the Insect that Shaped the American Frontier](http://amzn.to/2FnFcQv) was written by one of the key modern researchers on the topic, Jeffrey A. Lockwood. An entomologist by training who has expanded his personal masteries into nonfiction writing, he seems to have been the perfect candidate to perform both the modern science and painstaking historical research required to piece together the definitive account of our vanished swarms. I immediately bought the book, and for its first 100 pages or so it has been a delight. According to Lockwood, these swarm events were so regular and impactful that in affected areas hot summers into long, dry autumns became "grasshopper weather", and dramatic price cuts were labeled with "grasshopper prices" rather than our well known "fire sale". Early on, the book crossed over into another area of my interests, climate change.

### Locust Propagation and Locomotion

Dry, hot conditions were instrumental to the efficacy of the Rocky Mountain Locust's lifecycle. They grew faster and easier, with less natural restrictions (like the fungus that inhibited growth in damp climes). Leading up to the largest recorded swarm, in 1875, farmers and pioneers across a wide swathe of the the continent's midsection had been contending with extended drought. Despite the drought, it is reasonable to assume that these scattered communities were drawing more from the earth in terms of production than would otherwise have existed, providing a larger-than-natural food source for the escalating swarms. Already, we can see that a stretch of temporally-coincidental weather conditions engendered greater locust propagation, while the human impact on the natural environment was to wring additional energy sources for the swarm from the stricken earth. While reports from the IPCC and other bodies tend to recognize the possibility of increased damage by existing pests or the unknowable effects of those with suddenly increased ranges, they tend to avoid straying into the arena of apocalyptic plagues. But here, we have an example of just such a series of events abetted by abnormal weather and exacerbated by man's own tendency to transform and commoditize those places he colonizes.

Even the locomotion of these insects relied on an atmospheric and climatological phenomenon, the Great Plains low-level jet. This stream of air forms prior to summer and extends into the autumn, is hundreds of miles wide, and stretches from the Gulf to Canada. It can roll slowly along the mid-continent for days at a time if not interrupted by another system.  This jet is even strengthened by heat, the same weather that quickened locust growth and concentrated the swarms into area with food, which acted as a self-reinforcement mechanism for the chemically-driven swarm behaviors.

### A Changing World

Taken together, it seems almost obvious that the North American mid-continent would have been susceptible to swarming plagues. In fact, the 1875 swarm was several times over the largest in recorded history. While the Rocky Mountain Locust is extinct, it doesn't sound altogether unreasonable to posit that changing conditions and the interconnected world of the 21st century could unleash something similar. This is what I mean by known unknowns. We know that locust swarms used to be a fixed condition of American frontier life, and were exacerbated by conditions similar to those which we seems to be experiencing with more regularity today. While modern pesticides and farming techniques would probably have some level of efficacy in preventing or mitigating new outbreaks (and to even assume some is key to the human hubris which saturates all of our interactions with the world), the actual outcomes are unknown. Perhaps a more problematic species lays its eggs directly on crops, rather than underground where tilling might take a step or two out of the locusts' demographic pyramid. Consider a variant with the insecticide resistance of the brown marmorated stinkbug, whose resilience in those matters is such that farmers in affected regions were forced to apply multiples of their output from previous years. 

Even if we never see a locust (or similar) swarm of the size and power observed in 1875, it's still worth it to consider what has happened and what may again. Man's recent dominion over nature may seem to be growing shakier given the hurricanes and flooding, the bomb cyclones and polar vortices, but the truly damaging events will be those unpredictable or unheeded unknowns, whether or not they were once woven into the fabric of our lives.
