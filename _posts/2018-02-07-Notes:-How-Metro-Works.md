### How Metro Works

Yesterday I watched my train that should show up at 6:34, pull up and leave at 6:31 from outside the station before I could get to it.

Today I got to the station at 6:30 on the dot, and it said the train was 4 minutes out. The board said 4 minutes for several more minutes, then 2, then 1, then back to 2, and eventually arrival. By the time it did arrive it was 6:37, and as we sped away from the station I noticed my phone tick over to 6:38.

To recap, the train showed up 6 minutes later than the day before, and 3 minutes later than when you would expect it to show up based on train arrivals from WMATA's trip scheduler. Unfortunately I can't get that corroborating information from a timetable because it doesn't exist, they don't publish one at all.

The interval between trains at this time of day is supposed to be 8 minutes. Each of the last two days the trains has been off of the mark by 3 minutes (in both directions!), or 37.5% of the total ideal headway. I also have about an 8 minute walk from home to the metro, and a tight schedule between waking up and walking out the door. As I began commuting by train I left earlier and earlier until I hit upon a time where it is nearly impossible to not end up on a set of trains that will get me to work. I leave not only early enough to make sure I get on the train before the train I probably need, but even earlier to try and deal with that train's capricious timing. This is all a bit confusing in text form, so here's a graph to try and make sense of it.

I used [Pythonista](http://omz-software.com/pythonista/) on my phone to do this.
