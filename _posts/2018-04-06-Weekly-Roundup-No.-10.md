### Weekly Roundup No. 10 - April 6th, 2018
I got engaged last weekend, so that's pretty neat. She didn't even try to contain the "I knew, I knew the entire time" after saying yes, so aparently I'm not that sneaky. We were down at Westmoreland State Park, prospecting for fossils, of which we totally found a few, although no shark teeth (we're both terrible at spotting those). We also decided "Hey, our lease is up in a few months, can we buy a house?" Turns out there might be significant stress and planning requirements to both considering a wedding and a massive life-altering purchase like a home. I might not get back to writing consistently outside of roundup posts and [occasional GGWash snippets](https://ggwash.org/view/67123/are-dogs-urbanist-do-they-belong-in-cities) until some of these other endeavors are a bit more under control (or, in the case of buying a home, possibly abandoned).
Metro also somewhat burnt down near the end of last week, which results in a one way coomute approaching 2.5 hours. The bulk of which was spent between Ballston and Rosslyn. Then, yesterday, it actually melted down and that stretch of the orange line was completely shut between 6:30-8:30 or so, otherwise known as peak hours. I heard the announcement when waiting for my first blue line train, so I left the station and drove to work instead. This led me into one of the worst home-commuting snafus of the year, with google surfacing novel routes due to incredibly bad congestion. In the end I just kept working instead of changing the traffic, and ended up being in the office from 7:12 AM to 7:37 PM.

## Idle thoughts
* One way streets and better outcomes and demographics
* Check global sales of American cars
* Is it too early to put a label on Pruitt's non-regulatory malfeasance? Feel like we should throw it way back, past watergate. Teapot Townhouse scandal? Capitol Dome Townhome Caper? Make American scandal names unique again!
* Soy soy soy Simpsons gif
* Graph history CAFE standards and us auto sales as portion of world
* Sussurate
