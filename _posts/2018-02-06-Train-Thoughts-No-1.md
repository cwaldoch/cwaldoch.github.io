-Northern pass 1090 MW, $1.6 billion
-1 MMBtu of displaced gas is 0.059 tons of carbon
-Each MWh from a new CC is 6.5x0.059 = 0.3835
-73% more efficient to burn the gas in a power plant and then run electric furnaces for residential customers
-Each home needs 84000 Btus annually, or 0.084 MMBtu
-Need 0.577 MMBtus at a power plant for every 1 MMBtu in a home
-Let's say ~4 million households in New England 
-84000x0.577 = 48507 Btus/household x4M
194,028 MMBtus
-4Mx84k = 336,000 MMBtus
-141,972 MMBtus avoided 
-8,376 annual tons of carbon avoided at a cost of 4Mx18,000 = $72B ☠️
-northern pass displaces: ~500MWx8760=4,380,000 MWh x 8 = 35M MMBtus x 0.059 = ~2M tons of CO2 annually
