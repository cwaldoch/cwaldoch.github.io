### Weekly Roundup No. 4 February 23rd, 2018

This was a pretty busy week, but I have a ton of links because the busier I am with other things, the more I seem to read and find valuable (my backup list of articles for a week when I'm not reading much is getting to be obscenely long). Maybe it's a coping mechanism? 

I closed out the analysis on one annual report at work, and immediately moved onto another. This time, the work is novel, so I'm excited to really sink my teeth in. I also settled into a schedule of lifting and running after work Tuesday-Thursday, with yoga Monday/Friday, and pickup soccer on the weekends. Wednesday was shockingly warm, creeping up over 80 by the time I had to run to the metro station. My heart rate peaked around 20bpm higher than Thursday when it was 30 degrees cooler, even though my pace was nearly a minute faster yesterday. Also, Trump has no empathy, Republicans are morally and creatively bankrupt on guns, and the indictments keep on rolling.

# Thinking on

* Do NBA players who over perform in a contract year get overpaid relative to the tier they're in post performance increase?
* The non-fungibility of gas, causes its position globally to be significantly determined by politics
* While the USA does not have political will over its oil so much, as a commodity becomes more global and fungible, the country is able to exert greater indirect control via its businesses and spread/entrench its worldview in this manner. Additionally, we might have political power in matters of gas moving forward as we will probably be the pivotal supplier and user moving forward.
* What are interesting stats and visualizations to pull from the data being generated by my brother's new project, [Water Cooler Trivia](https://www.watercoolertrivia.com/)?
