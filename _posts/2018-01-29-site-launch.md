Finally put my own site together. Originally I messed around with several different tutorials for installing Ruby, gem-ing it up and taking control that way, but I realized I wanted something simpler. I ended up just directly working in my GitHub repo thanks to [this  excellent tutorial](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/), and then modified the layout and themes using [this](https://github.com/mojombo/mojombo.github.io). Plus, I wanted something that wouldn't get int he way very much, and allow me to just write, but also tinker (no more Wordpress plugins!) if need be within whatever my ability is in the moment.

I spent some time attempting to make this "prettier" which led me back down the Ruby trail and into 30 or so emails from GitHub telling me this page had failed to be created. Still lacking the understanding as to why this was the case, I decided to revert my last 30 or so changes to bring it back into working order. At least this design isn't cluttered.

My goals for this are to have a central repository for my writing, and I think that merging everything I do onto GitHub made sense. I'll be moving things over from my [Medium page](www.medium.com/@waldoch), and also [an older site where](www.btus.us) I did similar things. Any posts before 2015 are from Wordpress, anything pre-2018 was originally posted on Medium. I only specify that because the formatting on older posts might be weird, particularly when it comes to graphs I created years ago which might not be properly sized for this format.
