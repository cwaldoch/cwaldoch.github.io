Finally put my own site together. Originally I messed around with several different tutorials for installing Ruby, gem-ing it up and taking control that way, but I realized I wanted something simpler. I ended up just directly working in my GitHub repo thanks to [this  excellent tutorial](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/).

My goals for this are to have a central repository for my writing, and I think that merging everything I do onto GitHub made sense. I'll be moving things over from my [Medium page](www.medium.com/@waldoch), and also [an older site where](www.btus.us) I did similar things.
