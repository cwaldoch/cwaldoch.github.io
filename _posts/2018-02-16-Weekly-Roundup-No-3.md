## Things I did this week:

* Had a birthday and resolved to be in better shape when I hit 30 than I've been in my 20s. To that end I signed up for the free gym next to my office, and modified my commute so that I run the 1.5 miles form teh train station to the gym instead of taking a bus to the office. Yesterday I did a run->gym->work->gym->run cycle, which left me pretty dead. Goal is to do soemthing similar 2-3 times a week.
* Made a couple of BBQ tofu pizzas.

## Podcast+Thoughts:
------
Amongst all of the depravity and administrative carnage it's important to keep tabs on the heart of Trump, his North Star: ceaseless pursuit of personal enrichment, by any means. To that body of work, [Trump, Inc. seems like a solid addition](https://www.propublica.org/series/trump-inc). As a primer, these New Yorker pieces are also worth checking out.

* [Trump in Azerbaijan ](https://twitter.com/jowens510/status/961818017637154817)
* [Trump and Iran in Context](https://twitter.com/natesilver538/status/963621445782986752)
* [Trump, Mueller, and Georgia](https://twitter.com/emilyhholden/status/964300607589879808)
* [Really just everything from Adam Davidson](https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/adam-davidson)

## Idle Thoughts:
------
* Orange juice, why? What is the history of it? Why is that the dominant juice, America was founded on cider, but prohibition and our Wars kind of tag teamed to ruin that. Was orange juice and Florida in general an extreme right time and place situation?
* Headline I wouldn't be surprised to see: "American poor work harder and have less than anywhere else in the developed world."
* The news whiplash between Remington talking about bankruptcy a few days ago (basically because Obama is gone and white folks have less irrational fear to assuage through firearms), then gun stocks going up after the most recent shooting is a uniquely American and terrible juxtaposition.
